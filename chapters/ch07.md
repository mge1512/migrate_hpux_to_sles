### Package Management (SD-UX/Depots vs. RPM/zypper)

HP-UX uses **Software Distributor (SD-UX)**, centered on the swinstall, swlist, and swremove commands. SLES 16 uses the **Zypper** package manager, a frontend to libzypp and RPM.

#### Workflow Comparison

**A. Installing a Dependency-Heavy Package**

* HP-UX (The Manual "Dependency Hell"):  
  The administrator downloads git-2.3.depot.  
  Command: swinstall \-s /tmp/git-2.3.depot git  
  Result: Error. "The software dependencies for product 'git' are not met. Requires 'libiconv', 'gettext'."  
  Action: Admin must manually find, download, and stage the libiconv and gettext depots, then construct a complex command to install them all, or install them one by one. SD-UX does not possess a "solver" to fetch remote dependencies.22  
* SLES 16 (The SAT Solver Revolution):  
  SLES is connected to a repository (SUSE Customer Center or local RMT).  
  Command: zypper install git  
  Result: Zypper queries the metadata. It sees git needs libsha1, libpcre2, etc. It calculates the optimal installation order.  
  Output:  
  The following 5 NEW packages are going to be installed:  
  git git-core libsha1detectcoll1 libpcre2-8-0 perl-Error  
  Overall download size: 15.2 MiB. Already cached: 0 B.  
  Continue? \[y/n/...\] (y):

  *Insight:* The libzypp engine uses a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver to resolve complex dependency graphs, handling conflicts and architecture capabilities automatically—a massive productivity boost over SD-UX.23

**B. Listing Installed Software**

* HP-UX: swlist  
  Lists top-level "Bundles" and "Products".  
  swlist \-l fileset lists the granular components.  
* **SLES 16:**  
  * zypper se \-i: Lists installed packages with status 'i'.  
  * rpm \-qa: Lists all installed RPM headers.  
  * *Note:* In SLES, "Patterns" (meta-packages) function similarly to HP-UX "Bundles". zypper search \-t pattern lists these high-level groups (e.g., lamp\_server, sap\_server).23

**C. Querying Metadata and File Ownership**

* HP-UX: "Who owns /usr/bin/perl?"  
  Command: swlist \-l file | grep perl (Slow, parses text DB).  
* SLES 16:  
  Command: rpm \-qf /usr/bin/perl (Instant, queries binary DB).  
  Command: zypper info git (Shows description, version, source repo, and support status).

#### The Role of YaST and the Repository Model

HP-UX SD-UX repositories ("Depots") are usually static files or simple HTTP directories. SLES 16 uses a dynamic repository model managed by **YaST (Yet another Setup Tool)** or Zypper.

* **Repository Management:** In HP-UX, you specify the source \-s for every install. In SLES 16, you "subscribe" to channels once (zypper addrepo or via YaST Software Repositories). The system maintains a local cache of all available software metadata.  
* **YaST vs. Command Line:** YaST provides a comprehensive TUI/GUI for software management. Unlike HP-UX sam, which mostly wraps standard commands, YaST interacts directly with the RPM database and system config APIs.  
* **SLES 16 Shift:** While YaST remains, SLES 16 emphasizes **Cockpit** for web-based management and direct Zypper usage for automation. YaST is now considered in "maintenance mode," shifting focus to these newer tools.


##### ORIGINAL PLAN

* **7.1 Introduction: The Ecosystem Difference**
    * The philosophy of proprietary depots versus open-source repositories.
    * Binary compatibility and dependency resolution.
* **7.2 HP-UX Software Distributor (SD-UX)**
    * The structure of an **SD-UX Depot** (source and target).
    * Key commands: `swinstall`, `swlist`, `swremove`, `swconfig`.
    * Handling dependencies and conflicts in the HP-UX environment.
    * Patch management using `patchadd` and `patchdiag`.
* **7.3 SLES 16 RPM and the Zypper Tool**
    * Understanding the **RPM** package format and its structure.
    * The role of the **YaST Software Management** utility (GUI/TUI).
    * The power of **Zypper**:
        * Core commands: `zypper install`, `zypper remove`, `zypper search`, `zypper info`.
        * Managing repositories: `zypper addrepo`, `zypper refresh`, `zypper repos`.
        * Difference between `zypper update` and `zypper dist-upgrade`.
    * Using the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) and the SUSE Package Hub.
* **7.4 Managing Dependencies and Conflicts**
    * How `zypper` automatically handles the complexity of the Linux dependency tree.
    * Strategies for "locking" packages to prevent unwanted updates.
* **7.5 Comparing Installation Workflow**
    * Side-by-side comparison of installing, listing, and removing a typical application (e.g., Apache/httpd).
* **7.6 Summary: Flexibility vs. Control**
