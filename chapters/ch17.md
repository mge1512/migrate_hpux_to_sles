### Configuration Management: The Shift to IaC

HP-UX administration is historically imperative. Admins write intricate ksh or Perl scripts to loop through servers (remsh or ssh) to edit files using sed or awk. This leads to "Configuration Drift," where no two servers are exactly alike.  
SLES 16 is designed for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, specifically integrating **Ansible**.

#### Native Integration: Ansible System Roles

SLES 16 ships with **Ansible System Roles** (rhel-system-roles or suse-system-roles). These are vendor-supported playbooks.

* **The Difference:** Instead of writing a script to "Configure NTP," the admin defines the *desired state* in a YAML variable file.  
  YAML  
  \# vars.yml  
  timesync\_ntp\_servers:  
    \- hostname: pool.ntp.org  
      iburst: yes

  Then runs the role:  
  Bash  
  ansible-playbook \-i hosts timesync.yml

* **Why it matters:** The System Role handles the complexity of SLES 16 internals (editing /etc/chrony.conf, restarting chronyd, enabling the service, handling SELinux ports). It ensures **Idempotency**—running the playbook ten times results in the same state as running it once, without errors or duplicate config lines.  
* **SaltStack:** While Ansible is the focus for agentless config, SUSE Manager (SUMA) relies on **Salt**. SLES 16 includes the salt-minion package, allowing the OS to be controlled by a Salt Master for event-driven automation (Reactors), a concept absent in standard HP-UX.
