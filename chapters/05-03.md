## Quick Start: Two Paths to SLES 16

For an HP-UX administrator, the fastest way to understand SLES 16 is not to read about it, but to interact with the new CLI and directory structure. SUSE provides two friction-less paths to get a shell prompt without performing a full  installation on bare-metal.

### Path 1: Local Virtualization (The "Minimal VM" Image)

The **Minimal VM** images contain a ready-to-use minimal SLES 16 system with systemd, zypper, and network-manager pre-configured. These are perfect to start your journey with. 
**Steps:**

1. **Download:** Visit [download.suse.com](https://www.suse.com/download/sles/) and select "SLES 16".  
2. **Select Image Format:**  
   * **KVM/QEMU:** Download SLES-16.0-Minimal-VM.x86\_64-kvm-and-xen-GM.qcow2.  
   * **VMware ESXi/Workstation:** Download the .vmdk and corresponding .vmx files.  
   * **Hyper-V:** Download the .vhdx file.
   * **Other:** Download the .iso file and do a complete installation of SLES 16.
3. **Boot:** Attach the image to a new VM.  
4. **First Boot:** The image utilizes **Combustion** or **Ignition** for configuration, but if no config drive is found, it will default to an interactive wizard to set the root password and network.

### Path 2: Public Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

Running SLES 16 in the cloud is the preferred method for testing the new **Agentic AI** features and high-availability stacks without hardware provisioning.  
**Availability:**

* **AWS:** Available as an AMI in the EC2 console. Search for "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16".  
* **Azure:** Available in the Azure Marketplace.  
* **Google Cloud:** Select "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16" from the boot disk options when creating an instance.

Cloud-Specific Defaults to Note:  
Unlike the "Minimal VM" or ISO installs, public cloud images often have specific pre-configurations:

* **Network:** NetworkManager is the mandatory backend  
* **Security:** SELinux is set to Enforcing by default on standard SLES 16 images, though SLES for SAP variants may default to Permissive to ensure database compatibility during the transition period.  
* **Updates:** Instances are pre-wired to SUSE's Public Cloud Update Infrastructure, meaning zypper update works immediately without manual registration to SUSE Customer Center (PAYG models).
