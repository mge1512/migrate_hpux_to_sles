## Official Documentation and Technical Resources

The documentation for SLES 16 is part of the overall [documentation for SUSE products](https://documentation.suse.com/). As part of that, SLES 16 introduces a reorganized documentation structure. The "System Analysis and Tuning Guide" and "Storage Administration Guide" have been updated significantly to reflect the shift to Btrfs and systemd. Below are the essential resources for the transitioning administrator.
