## Security and Access Control

### DAC vs. MAC: The Conceptual Leap

HP-UX security is based on **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**. A user (or root) has discretion over the files they own. "Trusted System" (TCB) mode in HP-UX adds auditing and shadow passwords, but it is still fundamentally DAC.  
SLES 16 employs **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** via **SELinux** (Security Enhanced Linux). In MAC, the *policy* dictates access, not the user.

* **The Difference:** In HP-UX, if the apache user has rwx permissions on /etc/passwd, it can read/write it. In SLES 16 with SELinux, even if the apache user has 777 permission on /etc/passwd, the kernel will block the access because the SELinux policy for the httpd\_t domain does not grant write access to the passwd\_file\_t type.

### Administrative Challenges with SELinux

SLES 16 defaults to SELinux Enforcing mode (moving away from the AppArmor default of SLES 15).

* **Context Labels:** Every file has a label (viewable with ls \-Z). When an admin copies a config file from their home directory to /var/www, the file might retain the user\_home\_t label. Apache will be denied access.  
* **Troubleshooting:**  
  * *Wrong Way:* setenforce 0 (Disabling security).  
  * *Right Way:* Check /var/log/audit/audit.log. Use restorecon \-v /var/www/file to apply the correct label defined by the policy.  
* **Boolean Flags:** SLES 16 provides "knobs" to tune policy without rewriting it.  
  * Example: Allow Apache to connect to a remote database?  
  * Command: setsebool \-P httpd\_can\_network\_connect\_db 1\.  
    This level of granular control does not exist in HP-UX.
