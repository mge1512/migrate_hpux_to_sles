## Memory Management

### Memory Overcommit vs. Strict Allocation

HP-UX is conservative. A malloc() call generally reserves backing store immediately. If swap+RAM is full, malloc fails.  
SLES 16 (Linux kernel) is optimistic. It uses Overcommit. malloc almost always succeeds, returning a pointer to virtual memory. Physical memory is only allocated when the page is written to (Fault-in).  
Risk: If the system runs out of physical RAM, the Linux OOM Killer (Out of Memory Killer) activates. It uses a heuristic to select a process (often the one using the most memory, like a Database) and kill \-9 it to save the kernel.  
Mitigation for DB Servers:  
On SLES 16 hosting Oracle/SAP, administrators often tune /etc/sysctl.conf:

Bash

vm.overcommit\_memory \= 2  \# Strict accounting (like HP-UX)  
vm.overcommit\_ratio \= 50  \# Limit to Swap \+ 50% RAM

This forces the kernel to behave more like HP-UX, returning errors on malloc rather than killing random processes later.

**Caveat:** Please check the latest information on the SUSE website, and in the documentation of your ISV, whether these settings are recommended.
