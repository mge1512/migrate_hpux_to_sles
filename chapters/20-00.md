# Daily Administration and Command Tools

Moving from the HP-UX sam and command-line ecosystem to SLES 16 requires mastering a new set of tools that are generally more automated but abstract away more detail.

* System Management Tools (SMH/SAM vs. Cockpit)
* Package Management (SD-UX/Depots vs. RPM/zypper)
* LVM and Filesystems (HP LVM/VxFS vs. Linux LVM/Btrfs/Snapper)
* Networking Configuration (Traditional vs. NetworkManager)
* Command Shells (sh/ksh vs. Bash)
