## The UsrEtc Revolution and Filesystem Hierarchy Divergence

One of the most profound changes in SLES 16 is the adoption of the **UsrEtc** (Hermetic /usr) model. This is a significant deviation from the traditional Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) used by HP-UX and earlier Linux distributions.

### The Philosophy: Immutable Vendors, Mutable Admins

In HP-UX, as well as in earlier Linux distributions, the operating system and the local configuration are commingled. Let's review what this means taken a patch update as an example:

* **HP-UX Reality:** When you install a patch (PHSS\_xxxxx), it might update a config file in /etc/opt/. If the administrator had modified that file, SD-UX might create a .save file or simply overwrite it, leading to "configuration drift" and breakage during patching.  
* **SLES 16 Philosophy:** The /usr directory is the sole property of the OS vendor (SUSE). It is treated as immutable and can be mounted read-only. The /etc directory is the sole property of the administrator. This means that whatever changes an administrator has done in /etc, it will not be overwritten by a patch update.

### Practical Implications of UsrEtc

In SLES 16, configuration files are looked up in a specific hierarchy.

1. **Vendor Default:** /usr/etc/ (or /usr/share/defaults/etc/)  
2. **Admin Override:** /etc/

Workflow Example: Configuring SSH  
On HP-UX, you edit /etc/ssh/sshd\_config directly. If you mess up, you must restore from backup.  
On SLES 16:

1. The vendor supplies /usr/etc/ssh/sshd\_config (Read-only).  
2. The admin wants to change the port to 2222\.  
3. The admin creates /etc/ssh/sshd\_config containing *only* the override, or copies the vendor file to /etc and modifies it.  
4. The application reads /etc first.

**Insight:** This eliminates the problem of .save (HP-UX) or .rpmnew and .rpmsave (Linux) files. The package manager can update /usr/etc/ssh/sshd\_config freely without touching the admin's customization in /etc. For the administrator, this means grep \-r in /etc is no longer sufficient to find all configurations; one must check both /usr/etc and /etc to understand the *effective* configuration.

### The Partitioning of /opt and /usr/local

* **HP-UX:** /opt is the primary location for almost all software (SD-UX bundles install to /opt/package). /usr is often a mix of OS links and binaries.  
* **SLES 16:**  
  * /usr/bin: Primary location for package binaries.  
  * /opt: Reserved for large, self-contained third-party applications (Oracle DB, SAP HANA, Microsoft, proprietary agents).  
  * /usr/local: Reserved for software compiled manually by the admin (./configure && make install). SLES package manager will *never* touch files in /usr/local.
