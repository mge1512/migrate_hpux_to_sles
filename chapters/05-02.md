## Availability on different Hardware Architectures

Unlike HP-UX, which was tightly coupled to PA-RISC and later Itanium (IA64), SLES 16 is a cross-platform operating system. However, with version 16, SUSE has raised the instruction set baseline for modern processors. SLES 16 is officially available and supported on the following four architectures:

### x86-64 (AMD64 / Intel 64\)

* **Status:** Primary Enterprise Platform.  
* **Requirement:** **x86-64-v2** microarchitecture level or higher.  
* **Impact:** SLES 16 will **not boot** on very old x86-64 CPUs (roughly pre-2009, e.g., first-gen Core 2 Duo or early Opterons) that lack support for SSE4.2, SSSE3, and POPCNT instructions. Administrators repurposing old hardware for sandboxes must verify CPU flags using /proc/cpuinfo.

### IBM Power (ppc64le)

* **Status:** High-performance database and analytics platform (SAP HANA).  
* **Requirement:** **IBM Power10** or higher.  
* **Note:** While SLES 16 may technically boot on Power9 systems (running in Little Endian mode), SUSE officially supports only Power10 and newer processors for this release. This aligns with the lifecycle of high-end RISC hardware refresh cycles often seen in former HP-UX environments.

### IBM Z and LinuxONE (s390x)

* **Status:** Mainframe Linux.  
* **Requirement:** **IBM z14** or higher.  
* **Context:** For organizations consolidating HP-UX workloads onto mainframes, SLES 16 leverages the z/Architecture's specific crypto-acceleration and I/O channeling capabilities.

### Arm64 (AArch64)

* **Status:** Edge computing and high-density datacenter servers.  
* **Requirement:** **Armv8.0-A** or higher.  
* **Use Case:** Increasingly common in cloud environments (e.g., AWS Graviton) and energy-efficient datacenters. SLES 16 includes full support for ACPI on Arm, making it a viable target for general-purpose application migration from legacy UNIX systems.
