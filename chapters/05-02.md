## Availability on different Hardware Architectures

Unlike HP-UX, which was tightly coupled first to PA-RISC and later Itanium (IA64), SLES 16 is an operating system targetting "ubiquity": the availability on all Enterprise-grade hardware architectures and cloud-platforms, and serving all sizes and use cases from Edge and POS devices to datacenter and HPC deployments as well as working on huge scale-up machines. SLES 16 is officially available and supported on the following four architectures:

| Architecture        | Status / Primary Use Case | Minimum Requirement | Notes & Impact |
|:--------------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **x86-64** (AMD64 / Intel 64) | Most common Enterprise Platform | **x86-64-v2** microarchitecture level or higher | SLES 16 works on all recent hardware, but will not boot on very old x86-64 CPUs (roughly pre-2009, e.g., first-gen Core 2 Duo or early Opterons) that lack support for SSE4.2, SSSE3, and POPCNT instructions. Administrators repurposing old hardware for sandboxes must verify CPU flags using /proc/cpuinfo.|
| **IBM Power** (ppc64le) | High-performance DB (HANA) | **IBM Power10** or higher | While SLES 16 may technically boot on Power9 systems (running in Little Endian mode), SUSE officially supports only Power10 and newer processors for this release. This aligns with the lifecycle of high-end RISC hardware refresh cycles often seen in former HP-UX environments. |
| **IBM Z** & LinuxONE (s390x) | Mainframe Linux | **IBM z14** or higher | For organizations consolidating HP-UX workloads onto mainframes, SLES 16 leverages the z/Architecture's specific crypto-acceleration and I/O channeling capabilities. |
| **Arm64** (AArch64) | Edge & Cloud Datacenter | **Armv8.0-A**+ | Increasingly common in cloud environments (e.g., AWS Graviton) and energy-efficient datacenters. SLES 16 includes full support for ACPI on Arm, making it a viable target for general-purpose application migration from legacy UNIX systems. |
