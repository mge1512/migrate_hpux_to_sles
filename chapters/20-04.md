## Network Configuration (HP-UX netconf vs. SLES 16 NetworkManager)

For decades, HP-UX administrators have configured networking by editing a single, monolithic file: /etc/rc.config.d/netconf. The workflow was predictable: edit the file, run /sbin/init.d/net start, and troubleshoot using lanscan or lanadmin. In SLES 16, this paradigm has shifted completely. The old frameworks (Linux sysconfig and wicked network management framework (used in SLES 12 and 15) have been deprecated in favor of **NetworkManager**. While NetworkManager was historically viewed as a "desktop" tool, it is now the standard backend for SLES 16 server and cloud environments, providing a unified API for managing physical, virtual, and cloud networking.

### The Architectural Shift

#### From "Instance Numbers" to "Predictable Naming"

* **HP-UX:** Interfaces are assigned instance numbers (PPA) like lan0, lan1, lan2. These correlate to hardware paths (e.g., 0/1/2/0), but if a card is replaced, the instance number might change, requiring manual intervention with ioinit or nwmgr.  
* **SLES 16:** Linux uses **Predictable Network Interface Names**. Names are derived from firmware, topology, and location.  
  * eno1: Embedded Onboard interface 1\.  
  * ens33: PCI Express hotplug slot 33 (common in VMware).  
  * enp2s0: Ethernet on PCI bus 2, slot 0\.  
  * *Impact:* You no longer guess if lan0 is the built-in port or the add-on card. The name tells you exactly where it is physically located.

#### From Static Files to State Objects

In HP-UX, netconf is a shell script sourced at boot. In SLES 16, NetworkManager treats connections as "Profiles."

* **The Device:** The physical card (e.g., ens33).  
* **The Connection:** A configuration profile (IP, DNS, Routes) applied to a device.  
* *Key Concept:* You can have multiple profiles for one device (e.g., "Datacenter\_Static" and "Recovery\_DHCP") and switch between them atomically using nmcli.

#### The End of Direct /etc/resolv.conf Editing

On HP-UX, you edit /etc/resolv.conf to add nameservers. On SLES 16, **do not edit this file manually**. It is a symlink managed by netconfig. NetworkManager updates it dynamically based on the active connection profile. DNS settings must be added to the Interface Connection profile via nmcli.

### Comparison Table: HP-UX vs. SLES 16

The following table maps standard HP-UX networking tasks to their SLES 16 equivalents using nmcli (NetworkManager Command Line Interface).

| Feature / Task | HP-UX (Legacy) | SLES 16 (NetworkManager) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **List Physical Interfaces** | lanscan | nmcli device |
| | nwmgr -g -S lan | ip link show |
| **Show IP Configuration** | ifconfig lan0 netstat \-in | ip addr show ens33 nmcli device show ens33 |
| **Configure Static IP** | Edit /etc/rc.config.d/netconf: IP\_ADDRESS="10.0.0.1" SUBNET\_MASK="255.255.255.0" | nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.1/24 ipv4.method manual |
| **Configure Gateway** | Edit netconf: ROUTE\_GATEWAY="10.0.0.254" | nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.254 |
| **Configure DNS** | Edit /etc/resolv.conf | nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4" |
| **Apply Changes** | /sbin/init.d/net stop /sbin/init.d/net start | nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1" *(Changes apply immediately upon "up")* |
| **Link Aggregation** | **APA (Auto Port Aggregation)** Edit /etc/rc.config.d/hp\_apaconf lanadmin \-X \-a 900 1 3 | **Bonding** nmcli con add type bond ifname bond0 mode active-backup nmcli con add type ethernet ifname ens33 master bond0 |
| **VLAN Tagging** | nwmgr \-a \-S vlan \-c lan0... str\_cfg (deprecated) | nmcli con add type vlan con-name vlan100 dev ens33 id 100 ip4 192.168.100.1/24 |
| **Check Link Speed** | lanadmin \-x 0 nwmgr \-q info \-c lan0 | ethtool ens33 \`nmcli device show ens33 |
| **Routing Table** | netstat \-rn | ip route |
| **Hostname Config** | Edit /etc/rc.config.d/netconf hostname \<name\> | hostnamectl set-hostname \<name\> |

#### **Migration Warning: The ip command vs nmcli**

Experienced Linux admins often use the ip command (e.g., ip addr add...) for troubleshooting. However, changes made with ip are **ephemeral** and will be lost on reboot.

* **HP-UX Equivalent:** ifconfig lan0 10.0.0.1 (Temporary)  
* **SLES 16 Best Practice:** Always use nmcli to ensure configuration persists to disk (typically stored in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/).
